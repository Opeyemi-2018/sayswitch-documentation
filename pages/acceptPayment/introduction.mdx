## Introduction to Payments

### Getting Started with Sayswitch Payments

Sayswitch provides a robust payment processing system that allows you to accept payments from customers worldwide. This guide will help you understand the basics of implementing payments in your application.

### Payment Flow

1. **Initialize Payment**
   - Create a payment session
   - Set amount and currency
   - Specify payment methods

2. **Customer Payment**
   - Customer enters payment details
   - Payment is processed
   - Transaction is verified

3. **Confirmation**
   - Receive webhook notification
   - Update order status
   - Send confirmation to customer

### Basic Implementation

```javascript
const sayswitch = new Sayswitch({
  secretKey: process.env.SAYSWITCH_SECRET_KEY
});

// Initialize a payment
const payment = await sayswitch.payments.create({
  amount: 5000, // Amount in cents
  currency: 'USD',
  email: 'customer@example.com',
  reference: 'ORDER_REF_123',
  callback_url: 'https://your-website.com/callback'

```

## Server-to-Server (S2S) Payments

### Overview

Server-to-Server (S2S) payments enable direct communication between your server and Sayswitch’s payment platform, giving you complete control over how transactions are initiated and processed.

### Why Choose S2S?

- **Stronger Security**: Server-side processing helps minimize exposure to frontend vulnerabilities.
- **Full Control**: Orchestrate the payment experience entirely from your backend.
- **Ideal for Automation**: Perfect for handling subscriptions, recurring billing, and batch transactions.
- **Custom Integration**: Easily build tailored payment workflows.

### Requirements

To get started, ensure the following are in place:

- An active Sayswitch account with API access
- A server environment with support for TLS 1.2 or higher
- Your Secret API Key securely stored





### Security Guidelines

#### 1. TLS Setup

- Use **TLS version 1.2 or higher** to ensure secure data transmission
- Enable **strong cipher suites** for encrypted communication
- Apply **valid SSL certificates** for your server

#### 2. Data Security Practices

- **Encrypt sensitive information** such as card data or personal identifiers
- **Sign API requests** to validate authenticity
- Store your **API keys securely** using environment variables or secret managers

### Payment Processing Workflow

#### 1. Authentication

- Authenticate each request using your Sayswitch API credentials
- Optionally generate and attach a **request signature** for added verification

#### 2. Transaction Execution

- Send the payment information securely to the API
- The server processes the transaction and responds with the result
- Handle and interpret the API response accordingly

#### 3. Post-Transaction Verification

- Confirm the transaction status via response or webhook
- Process any incoming **webhook notifications**
- Update your system records based on the final outcome

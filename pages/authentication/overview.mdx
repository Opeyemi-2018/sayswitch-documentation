## Authentication

### Overview

Sayswitch uses API keys to authenticate requests. You need to obtain your API keys from the Sayswitch Dashboard before you can make API calls. We provide two types of keys:

- **Public Key**: Used for client-side operations
- **Secret Key**: Used for server-side operations (must be kept secure)

### API Keys

#### Test Mode vs Live Mode

Each environment has its own set of API keys:

- **Test Keys**: Used for development and testing
- **Live Keys**: Used for processing real transactions

### Authentication Headers

Include your API key in the Authorization header of your requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never expose your secret key**
   - Keep it on your server
   - Don't include it in client-side code
   - Don't commit it to version control


3. **Rotate Keys Regularly**
   - Generate new keys every few months
   - Update all integration points
   - Revoke old keys after successful migration

### Key Management

- Access your keys in the [Sayswitch Dashboard](https://merchant.sayswitchgroup.com)
- Generate new keys as needed
- Revoke compromised keys immediately
- Monitor key usage in dashboard

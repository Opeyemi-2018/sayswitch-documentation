## API Keys

### Overview

Sayswitch uses API keys to authenticate requests. Each key is designed for specific use cases and environments.

### Key Types

#### Public Keys
- **Format**: `pk_test_...` (test) / `pk_live_...` (live)
- **Usage**: Client-side operations, payment initialization
- **Security**: Safe to expose in frontend code

#### Secret Keys
- **Format**: `sk_test_...` (test) / `sk_live_...` (live)  
- **Usage**: Server-side operations, payment processing
- **Security**: Keep private - never expose in client code

### Getting Your Keys

1. Login to [Sayswitch Dashboard](https://merchant.sayswitchgroup.com)
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Copy your keys for integration

### Authentication

Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET https://backendapi.sayswitchgroup.com/api/v1/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_your_secret_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Protect Secret Keys**
   - Store in environment variables
   - Never commit to version control
   - Keep out of client-side code

2. **Environment Separation**
   - Use test keys for development
   - Use live keys only in production

3. **Key Rotation**
   - Rotate keys every 6 months
   - Replace immediately if compromised

### Key Permissions

| Key Type | Permissions |

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Check key format and validity |
| `403 Forbidden` | Verify correct key type for operation |
| Environment errors | Ensure test/live key matches endpoint |

## API Keys

### Understanding Sayswitch API Keys

Sayswitch provides two types of API keys for secure authentication:

#### Public Keys
- Start with `pk_`
- Safe to expose in client-side code
- Used for client-facing operations
- Available for both test (`pk_test_`) and live (`pk_live_`) modes

#### Secret Keys
- Start with `sk_`
- Must be kept secure and private
- Used for server-side operations
- Available for both test (`sk_test_`) and live (`sk_live_`) modes

### Getting Your API Keys

1. Log in to your [Sayswitch Dashboard](https://dashboard.sayswitch.com)
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Generate or view your API keys

### Key Security Guidelines

1. **Never Share Secret Keys**
   - Keep secret keys on your server
   - Don't include them in public repositories
   - Don't expose them in client-side code

2. **Key Rotation**
   - Rotate keys every 6 months
   - Immediately rotate if compromised
   - Update all integration points after rotation

3. **Environment Separation**
   - Use test keys for development
   - Use live keys only in production
   - Keep environments strictly separated

### API Key Permissions

| Key Type | Allowed Operations |
|----------|-------------------|
| Public Key | - Payment initialization - Client-side validation - Public endpoints |
| Secret Key | - Payment verification - Refunds - Webhooks - All API endpoints |

### Troubleshooting

Common API key issues and solutions:

- **Authentication Error**: Verify correct key format and environment
- **Invalid Key**: Ensure key hasn't been revoked or expired
- **Access Denied**: Check if using correct key type for operation

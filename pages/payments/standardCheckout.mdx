## Standard Checkout

The Standard Checkout integration enables you to create a secure, one-time payment link that customers can use to complete their transactions safely.


### Step 1: Start the Payment Process
Make a server-side `POST` request to the payment initialization endpoint with the following payload:
```js
{
    "email": "test@email.com",
    "amount": "100",
    "callback": "https://webhook.site/1580cf0d-9dd7-4baa-becb-f4d8747eba35",
    "currency": "NGN"
}
```

| Field     | Type   | Required | Description                                                  |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| email     | string | Yes      | The email address of the customer making the transaction     |
| amount    | string | Yes      | The amount to be charged or processed                        |
| callback  | string | Yes      | The URL to receive webhook notifications after transaction   |
| currency  | string | Yes      | The currency for the transaction (e.g., NGN for Naira)       |


### Step 2: Send the Customer to the Payment Page
Upon a successful request, we’ll return a unique link or access code for the payment page. Redirect your customer to this page to complete their payment.

### Response
```js
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Authorization URL created",
    "data": {
        "authorization_url": "https://checkout.sayswitchgroup.com/pay/SSW_17471703346211972",
        "access_code": "ekns5nhydaaa",
        "reference": "SSW_17471703346211972",
        "payer_id": null
    }
}
```

### Step 3: After the Payment

Once the transaction is successfully completed, the following actions will take place:

1. The customer will be redirected to your specified `redirect_url`, with query parameters such as `status` and `reference`.
2. If webhooks are enabled, a notification will be triggered and sent to your configured webhook endpoint. [Learn more about webhooks](#).
3. A confirmation receipt will be emailed to the customer if the payment was successful, unless this option is disabled.
4. You will also receive a transaction email notification, unless you've opted out of this feature.

<Callout type='info'>
 On your server, ensure that you handle the redirect properly and always verify the final status of the transaction for accuracy.
